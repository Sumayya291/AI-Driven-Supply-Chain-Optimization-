## 📌 Project Overview
Modern supply chains face challenges such as unpredictable demand, inefficient routing, inventory wastage, and lack of real-time visibility. This project proposes an AI-driven architecture that solves these issues using:

- Predictive analytics  
- Real-time data streams  
- Optimization algorithms  
- Intelligent monitoring  

This project was developed as a **conceptual engineering project** to understand how AI can enhance logistics and supply chain systems.
